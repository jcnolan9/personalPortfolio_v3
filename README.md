# personalPortfolio_v2

## Description
In this assignment I am updating my personal portfolio page using skills learned after the completion of the original assignment. Here I am using Bootstrap, a CSS framework, for the styling
of the page as opposed to pure CSS. My goal was to get more practice with 3rd party CSS frameworks as they are a powerful and convenient tool for styling on the web.
